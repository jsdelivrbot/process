# Process vocab

This is a component of the ValueFlows vocabulary. See the current VF spec here: https://www.valueflo.ws/

## Why?

We know of three different projects that use Process in compatible ways, and are interested in collaborating. We hope more will come.

## Who uses this?

So far, [NRP](https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork), [IPOTables](http://ipotables.net/), and [Local Economic Development](http://locecon.org/). And you?
